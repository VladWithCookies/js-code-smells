# Divergent Change
## Reason
You find yourself having to change many unrelated methods when you make changes to a class. For example, when adding a new product type you have to change the methods for finding, displaying, and ordering products.

Often these divergent modifications are due to poor program structure or "copypasta programming‚Äù.

## Solutions
### Extract Class
