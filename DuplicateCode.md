# Duplicate Code
## Reason
Duplication usually occurs when multiple programmers are working on different parts of the same program at the same time. Since theyâ€™re working on different tasks, they may be unaware their colleague has already written similar code that could be repurposed for their own needs.

## Solutions
### Extract Superclass
```js
// Bad
class Tank {
  getHealth() {
    //...
  }
}

class Soilder { 
  getHealth() {
    //...
  }
}

// Better
class Unit {
  getHealth() {
    //...
  }
}

class Tank extends Unit {
  //...
}

class Soilder extends Unit { 
  //...
}
```

### Pull Up Field
```js
// Bad
class Unit {
  //...
}

class Tank extends Unit {
  getHealth() {
    //...
  }
}

class Soilder extends Unit { 
  getHealth() {
    //...
  }
}

// Better
class Unit {
  getHealth() {
    //...
  }
}

class Tank extends Unit {
  //...
}

class Soilder extends Unit { 
  //...
}
```

### Pull Up Constructor Body
```js
// Bad
class Employee {
  //...
}

class Manager extends Employee {
  constructor(name: string, id: string, grade: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.id = id;
    this.grade = grade;
  }
  // ...
}

// Better
class Employee {
  constructor(name: string, id: string) {
    this.name = name;
    this.id = id;
  }
  // ...
}

class Manager extends Employee {
  constructor(name: string, id: string, grade: number) {
    super(name, id);
    this.grade = grade;
  }
  // ...
}
```
