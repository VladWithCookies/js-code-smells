# Dead Code
## Reasons
When requirements for the software have changed or corrections have been made, nobody had time to clean up the old code.

Such code could also be found in complex conditionals, when one of the branches becomes unreachable (due to error or other circumstances).

## Solutions
Delete unused code and unneeded files.
